    <h2 id="aca">Academic interests</h2>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>I really enjoy programming in my job and that is one of the reasons I am
        taking the course on Javascript this semester. What I enjoy most about
        programming is creating something useful.
    </p>

    <h3>Leadership and organizational development</h3>
    <p>I have a bachelors degree studying leadership, quality and improvement.
        What motivates me to study these areas are the way focusing on them
        can improve the output and also the job enjoyment for the employees.

    <h2 id="hob">Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Dogs</h3>
    <p>
        I got my first dog 14 years ago, an Akita Inu named Suki.
        That was a dream come true! Sadly she passed away two years ago and I got a puppy,
        an Akita Inu named Kenzo.<br>
        The image below pictures my first dog Suki with my sisters puppy three years ago in 2021.

    <ol>
        <li>Suki, Akita, female, 2010-2022</li>
        <li>Kenzo, Akita, male, 2022-</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Ceramics</h3>
    <p>
        Four years ago I discovered the joy of working with clay! Since then I have set up my
        own ceramics studio where I create ceramics and give classes.<br>
        The image below shows two mugs I have made, they are some of my favorites.<br>

    </p>
    <h3>Travel and reading</h3>
    <p>Other lifelong hobbies of mine are traveling and books.
        I have been to every continent but Antarctica. Since the covid pandemic I have'nt
        been on any longer trips though so I hope that will change in the near future.
        Something I enjoy doing on my free time is reading books, mainly suspense novels och crime.
